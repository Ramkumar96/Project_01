## Tracking the animals and its path using CCTV footages.

Description:
 Animals can damage to a home, apartment and office any type of building through gnawing, nest-building, and defecation. In that case, they can damage our datastores such as papers, printed documents, and books, etc. As an example mice will chew on just about anything that they see as useful in building their nests. This proposed project aims to find the harmful animals and their paths on CCTV footage.
